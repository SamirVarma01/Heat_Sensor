# Heat_Sensor
This is a simple Arduino heat-sensing device that converts ADC readings into voltage and then converts that voltage into temperature readings.
The sensor uses a baseline of 30 degrees Celsius and lights up to three LEDs depending on how far above that baseline the detected temperature
is. Currently, it uses increments of 2 degrees.
